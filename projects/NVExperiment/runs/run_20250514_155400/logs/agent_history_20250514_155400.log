[2025-05-14 15:54:11] USER: characterize NV for me

To characterize an NV center, we should follow a systematic approach:
1. First, perform a galvo scan to locate NV centers in the sample
2. Then use find_nv to precisely locate a promising NV center
3. Finally, run ESR to characterize its quantum properties
4. If needed, we can optimize the measurements

Let's start with the galvo scan. I'll first check the default galvo scan configuration and then request permission to run the scan.

[2025-05-14 15:58:58] ASSISTANT: (THINK) I'll modify the ESR configuration with the user's specified parameters and run the measurement:
1. Write new config with:
   - freq_start: 2.84e9
   - freq_stop: 2.89e9
   - freq_points: 40
   - power_out: -5.0
2. After writing, run the ESR measurement
3. Wait for results before proceeding further

I noticed my previous run command had an error in the script path. I need to:
1. Correct the script path to use "ESR" instead of "esr_RnS"
2. Keep all the configuration we just created
3. Run the corrected command

The configuration file is already written with our desired parameters, so we just need to run it with the correct script name.
